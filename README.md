# Data Visualization Project: SupITShop Leaflet
This is my project for the "Data Visualization Specialist: Concepts" module in my 3rd year at SUPINFO. The goal of this project is to create a leaflet that showcases the activities of SupITShop, a company that specializes in digital technologies.

## Project Overview
SupITShop is a company that provides a wide range of digital services to its clients, including web development, mobile app development, and data analysis. To create the leaflet, I first gathered data on the company's services, clients, and projects. I then used this data to create visualizations that highlight SupITShop's strengths and achievements.
